I had added __nāgarī to the relevant xml:ids, except for ratnaśrīṭīkā-ROMAN.xml and sarasvatikanthabharana-ROMAN.xml, to which I have added __roman. These are the only two to which I have applied the devanāgarī-to-roman transliteration; to all others I have applied a roman-to-devanāgarī transliteration. I have skipped over the enormous mahabharata, which is transliterated anyway and which would certainly freeze my computer.
