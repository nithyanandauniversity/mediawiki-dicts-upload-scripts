#+TITLE: Readme SARIT bibliography

The file [[./sarit.bib]] contains the current SARIT bibliography.  The aim
is to eventually get everything we need from the TEI files
themselves. There is, however, currently no simple/dependable
mechanism that can do this.

For the moment, it seems easiest to have a bibliography in a more
useful format ([[https://www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex?lang=en][biblatex]]).  Please feel free to transform the .bib file
into other formats that seem useful to you.  The only requirements are
that the keys stay the same in all formats, and that they correspond
to the xml:id-s of the various bibliographic items in the SARIT corpus
(e.g., bibl, biblStruct, msDesc).
